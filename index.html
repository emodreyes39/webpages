    <p><b>My name is Erik Modesto Reyes and I am from Garner, North Carolina.</b> <u>I am a first-year student majoring in Computer Engineering.</u>  <i>I chose this major due to my curiousity of working with computers and hardware components.</i></p>
        <br/>
    <p>After graudation. I want to work at Lenovo as a hardware engineer as I have lots of connections with the company and utilize what I have learned at school. However, my alternative job would be a software engineer at Red Hat as they specialized in Linux, an open-source operating system. Either way, I am flexible on what I would like to work on as long that my earnings are big.</p>
